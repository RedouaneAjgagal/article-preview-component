## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Media Queries
- Vanilla JS

### Challenges

- I had problems with the image and still couldn't make it take the whole height without beeing stretched.
- I tried to make the share button changes it's color on focus but that didnt work well, so i decided to use "setAttribute" in JS and make the src change when ever you click on the button. So i made two share-icons and each one has a color.
